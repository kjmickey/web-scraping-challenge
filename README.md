Part 2

I was unable to get /scrape to work correctly and as a result never got to the actual html.  

I do know that `scrapemars.py` works, and `app.py` works enough that clicking refresh on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ triggers the following in the console

```
127.0.0.1 - - [27/Feb/2021 23:22:58] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 - -
```
